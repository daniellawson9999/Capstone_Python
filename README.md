Python Reinforcement Learning for FTC

## Project Description

This project was originally created for a senior year capstone project. Now that the project is winding, I plan on creating a little bit of documentation in case other people would like to contribute to this project. 

Currently, this project contains a large portion of code unrelated to the project and test and legacy code. Additionally, the sctructure of the code could be much cleaner. If other individuals are interesting in working on the project, this will become an a major area to work on. 

Right now, some results have been scucesfully transfered to real life. There are a lot of different approaches I would like to try, which I will be working on while I still have time.
