Python Reinforcement Learning for FTC

## Project Description

This project was originally created for a senior year capstone project. My inititial goal was to create a system that would create the foundation for a fully autonomous teleop program. Now that the project is winding, I plan on creating a little bit of documentation in case other people would like to contribute to this project. 

Currently, this project contains a large portion of code unrelated to the project and test and legacy code. Additionally, the sctructure of the code could be much cleaner. If other individuals are interesting in working on the project, this will become an a major area to work on. 

Right now, some results have been scucesfully transfered to real life. There are a lot of different approaches I would like to try, which I will be working on while I still have time. 


## Project Structure 
coming soon, main project code is contained within: https://github.com/daniellawson9999/Capstone_Python/tree/master/Robot/Rotation

## Resources

For now, here are some slides and videos about the project. I can attach scripts soon:

If you would like to know more about deep q learning, I would recommend the [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf) which presented this approach. 
## Setup
Currently, it can be difficult to properly setup your dependencies. I will make a recommended setup guide and will eventually use a service such as docker.

## To-do List
in progress, applying other forms of rl
